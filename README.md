## Hi there!
I have developed a website using Rest APIs on cats, in which we can perform basic CRUD operations such as adding a new cat to the homepage, viewing the details of a specific cat, updating information about cats, and deleting cats from the homepage. I used a JSON file to store cat data and to perform all CRUD operations on this file. You can make some little changes to the json file and create your favorite animal page.

To run this website on your PC, you must have node.js installed.

Once you have installed nodejs, clone this directory, and then run the following command in your Terminal in the project directory to install the required node modules:

> npm install

Finally, to check that the website is working properly, in the Windows environment, run:

> node index.js

Now, if you head to http://localhost:3000/cats , you will see the following output:
